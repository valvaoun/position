#FiveM Player Position

This script allows to save and restore the position of the players in an FiveM server. 
The positions are saved in a MySQL database and the players are automatically teleported to their last saved position when they reconnect.

#Features

Automatic Save: Saves the player's position in the database when logging out.
Automatic Restoration: Teleports the player to his last saved position when reconnecting.
Manual Command: Players can use the /save command to manually save their current position.

#Use

Make sure that your server is configured to use a MySQL database.
Start your resource and connect to the server to test the backup and restore of positions.

#Configuration
